# Fitness-App
My own workout app, starting from the very basics of my programming knowledge and improving as I learn new things.

The first version is very repetitive and simple. It has mutliple functions that act as each day of exercises.
They are predetermined and cannot be changed unless added to or changed completely in the code.

In future versions, I want to:
  - allow the user to update the workout plans whenever they want.
    - types of exercises
    - numbers of reps and sets
    - rest time 
  - create a gui so that you have a screen to look at and not the console
  - use sounds (i.e to signal end of rest time)
