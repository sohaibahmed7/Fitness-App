# Version 1

fit_app_V1

My own workout app, starting from the very basics of my programming knowledge and improving as I learn new things.

The first version is very repetitive and simple. It has mutliple functions that act as each day of exercises.
They are predetermined and cannot be changed unless added to or changed completely in the code.

In future versions, I want to:
  - allow the user to update the workout plans whenever they want.
    - types of exercises
    - numbers of reps and sets
    - rest time 
  - create a gui so that you have a screen to look at and not the console
  - use sounds (i.e to signal end of rest time)

# Version 2

WorkoutApp_2.py

In this version, I revamped the entire program by introducing the use of .txt files which hold the contents for each workout
(i.e exercise name, # of sets, amount of rest time)

The benefit to this is it provides the user with the ability to easily make changes to the plan, and it requires much less code to execute.

However the program is not complete, I still want to:
- allow the user to make changes within the application itself
- create a gui so that you have a screen to look at and not the console
- use sounds (i.e to signal end of rest time)

# Version 3

WorkoutApp_3.py

In this version, I developed the basis for a GUI implementation of my app. 

It still uses .txt files to hold the contents for each workout which makes it easily editible.

Of course, the program is still not complete, in the next version I want to:
- add sounds, dynamic changes in colour, animations
- allow the user to make file changes within the app
- further exercise options
- and more...
